# The Dataset
#-The dataset contained 614 values with 13 columns.
#-The data contained missing values in 7 variables.

# Dealing with null values
#A histogram was plotted for the ['Applicant Income','Coapplicant Income', 'Total Income' and 'Loan Amount'] columns. They were found to be slightly right skewed. To normalize the data, the log values of the data was obtained which then made the data normalized.
#To deal with the null values, the mode measure of central tendency was applied to the categorical variables
#The numerical data was dealt with using the mean measure of central tendency.

# Analyzing the data
